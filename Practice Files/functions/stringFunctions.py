# Your friend is sending you a text message, however his caps lock is broken and the whole message is in uppercase.
# Noone likes being shouted at, plus uppercase text is hard to read, so you decide to write a program to convert the text to lowercase and output it.
#
# Take a string as input and output it in lowercase.

text = input()
print(text.lower())
